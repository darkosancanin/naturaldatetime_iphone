## Overview 
iPhone client for the Natural Date and Time application.

Natural Date and Time is a natural language date and time zone engine which allows you to view time and date information for any major city in the world. You can do time zone conversions and view the current time and daylight saving time information about cities all by querying in natural English text.

Note: I wrote and released this application in 2012. It is not currently available on the Apple App Store.

See https://github.com/darkosancanin/naturaldatetime_web and http://www.naturaldateandtime.com for more details on the application.
